# SteamTradeBot
This is a steambot developed by CloudiaN that get's the market prices from the market and updates them live in to the database.
The bot is FREE, Easy to setup (You run install.bat), and tells you everything it does (Every trade and why.).

## Why use a steambot?
Well, there are many reasons why you should use and develope a steambot. Maybe you have a big inventory and want to do all the trades automatic. This is where the this steambots truly shines. The bot is getting the prices that are updated realtime from the steam servers. Or let's say that you want to make a trading website or a gambling website? These site are based on steambots. But we believe in a simple solution without complicated code or logs in the console. We are also currently in the development of an 'User interface' that's gonna be available for the more "premium" users.

## How do I set it up?
We try to focus a lot on setup and installation for the bot for the people that are not really in to coding or thinks it's complicated.
Here is what you have to do:

1. Download the zip file, press on the green button that says "Clone or download" and download it as a .zip file. 
2. Extract the files to another location on your computer. We recommend creating a folder called "steambot" on your desktop. 
3. Install NodeJS. Nodejs is the core of this bot. You simply need it for it to work. Here is a link: https://nodejs.org/en/
4. Install Desktop Authinticator, you dont have to but if you want it AUTOMATIC this step is REQUIRED: https://github.com/Jessecar96/SteamDesktopAuthenticator
5. Find your shared secret & identity secret. Here is a video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjdOJVSZ9Mo
6. Edit the config.json. Note that set the sharedsecret & identitysecret to the one you've got from step 5. 
7. Run install.bat
8. You're all set. You now have a steambot running on your steamaccount! 

### Withdrawing items from your bot.
If you've got the bot set to another account than your name, please fill in your Steam64ID inside the config file where ownerid is. 
(WE RECOMMEND HAVING A SEPERATE STEAM ACCOUNT FOR THE BOT AND TRADING).

### Information you may want to know
By default there isn't set a multiplier to the bot. This is planned to be added by the end of march 2018. And also there will be added filters to the bot to make it not be able to accepte trades containing cases for a higher tier skin or lots of lower tier for a hightier. If you now how to set this up please contact us (cloudianbusiness@gmail.com) and you can hop abord on this project.

### Edit & Change Bot.js
If you're not an experienced developer we don't recommend changing stuff in the code. Changing stuff can make the bot act weird and maybe do bad trades or crash ect. If you are a developer the code is opensource so you can basicly edit whatever you want. If you make some major changes please send them to us and we will take a look at them and maybe add them to the main script. As I said. This bot is free to use if you make under 10.000$ per year. 

### Developer - CloudiaN
The steam was originally created by just on guy. (CloudiaN), but we are working on making a better and a more experienced team.
If you want me to code a custom bot working with your website or whatever you need a bot to do, then please contact me. 

### Donate to the project
Right now, there is no way to donate to the project. But if we get more users and downloads we will be sure to make a donate page where you can support what we do and our work. The donations will be put in to making the next update or making the experience better for the users of the bot.
